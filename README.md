team project Title: Analyzing Adolescent Tobacco Consumption Patterns. Team Members: Mereissa Henrie, Derilee Walters, Love Lorissaint, Sacide Belair. 
The project attempts to determine how youngsters across the United States are using tobacco, unravel the most common types of smoking products they favor the most and in which states usage rates are higher, representation of current smoking status, and establishes smoking patterns by education and gender, as these indicators are also vital.  The dataset is drawn from (CSV file: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj//youth-tobacco-survey) and will be reworked, cleaned, and broken into manageable pieces with detailed analyses and visualizations.
Questions: What are the most frequently used tabocco products among young people?
Geographic: is there a correlation between state and reduced rates of yourh tobacco usage?
What is the current measure of youth smoking status in the past based on educational level and gender?
